### **User Story**

- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

---

### **Business Context**

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**

Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.

The user should be able to:

- Sort the table by at least one category

- Filter the users by at least one property.

---

### **Installation**

```bash
npm install
```

### **Usage**

#### **1. Filtering**
