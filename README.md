### __Description__
`React` is the most popular front-end technology right now. This React application is to demonstrate its power of fast dynamic rendering. The table is dynamatically updated whenever user types in something in search bar, no button clicking is required. Moreover, user can sort each column by clicking on the header, either in ascending order or descending order. 

---

### __User Story__

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

---

### __Business Context__

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

---

### __Acceptance Criteria__

Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
